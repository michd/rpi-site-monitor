# `$ ./monitor myconfig.conf`

# Configure LED pins and sites to check below.

# Note: this is wait time after all checks have been completed.
# Ping response and curl connection time make the cycle longer,
# So be aware this number is not "execute every x seconds".

# Configure LEDs, hosts and sites below.
# led_g[x] is the GPIO pin number for the Green LED,
# led_r[x] is the GPIO pin number for the Red LED.
# This assumes dual color LEDs with red and green in one package.
# Having red and green on at the same time creates yellow.

# host[x] is the host which will be pinged
# url[x] is the url which will be checked for http status
# Redirects will be followed, and only 200 and 204 are seen as OK

# All LED pin numbers are GPIO numbers, not physical pin numbers on the board.
# Look up a pin chart for your board to figure out what your pin numbers are.
